# Ingredients-Analysis-using-Natural-Language-Processing
Supermarkets offer a wide range of food products, and most people select items based on their appearance or brand appeal. Only a few take the time to turn the packet around and check the ingredientsâ€”and even then, we're not all nutritionists who understand what those ingredients truly mean. This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and interpret food ingredients more effectively.
