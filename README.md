# Ingredients-Analysis-using-Natural-Language-Processing
## Overview
Supermarkets offer a wide range of food products, and most people select items based on their appearance or brand appeal. Only a few take the time to turn the packet around and check the ingredients—and even then, we're not all nutritionists who understand what those ingredients truly mean. This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and interpret food ingredients more effectively.

# Understanding Terminologies
1. ***Customized Named Entity Recognition (CNER)***
- We all have learnt about NER which is Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER is pretrained to recognize some entities like Location, Name etc.
- This project is an attempt to leverage NER and it's customization abilities for ingredients' analysis. We do this with the help of Customized Named Entity Recognition (CNER).
- ***What is Customized Named Entity Recognition (CNER):***  A Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to identify and classify specific entities (like food ingredients) in text into predefined categories (e.g., Healthy, Unhealthy, Additive). “Customized” here implies training a model for domain-specific needs (i.e., food ingredients), rather than using a generic model.
